Overview: 
In this project, I wanted to see how much a child’s home environment affects 
their success. I looked at how things like a mother's education and her work
status, which I grouped together as "family advantage" connect with her IQ to 
influence her child's test scores.

The Double Advantage
The graph below breaks down these test scores. I grouped the families by their
advantage level and separated them by the mother's IQ to see if having a more
"advantaged" background makes a difference even when IQ is the same.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_iq <- kidiq %>%
  mutate(
    family_advantage = case_when(
      mom_hs == 0 & mom_work <= 2 ~ "Low advantage",
      mom_hs == 0 & mom_work >  2 ~ "Mixed advantage",
      mom_hs == 1 & mom_work <= 2 ~ "Mixed advantage",
      mom_hs == 1 & mom_work >  2 ~ "High advantage",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ),
    iq_group = case_when(
      mom_iq <= quantile(mom_iq, 0.33, na.rm = TRUE) ~ "Lower IQ Group",
      mom_iq <= quantile(mom_iq, 0.67, na.rm = TRUE) ~ "Middle IQ Group",
      TRUE ~ "Higher IQ Group"
    ),
    family_advantage = factor(family_advantage,
                              levels = c("Low advantage","Mixed advantage","High advantage")),
    iq_group = factor(iq_group,
                      levels = c("Lower IQ Group","Middle IQ Group","Higher IQ Group"))
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(family_advantage), !is.na(iq_group)) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = family_advantage, y = kid_score, fill = family_advantage)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.6, width = 0.8, color = NA) +
  stat_summary(fun = median, geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5, color = "black", fatten = 1) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.10, height = 0, alpha = 0.25, size = 1.2, color = "black", show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ iq_group, nrow = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2", guide = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Low advantage"="Low","Mixed advantage"="Mixed","High advantage"="High")) +
  labs(
    title = "Child Scores by Family Background and Maternal IQ",
    subtitle = "Higher family advantage leads to higher scores even within the same IQ groups.",
    x = "Family Advantage Level",
    y = "Child's Test Score",
    caption = "Data: NLSY (Gelman & Hill, 2007)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 11),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  )

print(plot_iq)
```

Understanding the Results: 
The plot suggests that a child’s test performance is not determined by maternal IQ alone, but is heavily influenced by the family's socio-economic environment. In the lower and middle IQ groups, there is a clear upward trend: as family advantage increases, child test scores rise accordingly. This indicates that factors like a mother’s education and employment status provide a vital support system that can significantly improve developmental outcomes.

A key finding in this visualisation is the "equalsing" effect of a high-advantage home. Children born to mothers in the lower IQ group who have high family advantage often achieve scores comparable to children in the middle IQ group. This suggests that a stable, advantaged environment can effectively bridge the gap in test scores. While the impact of family advantage appears to level off for mothers who already have high IQs, the overall pattern confirms that a supportive home environment is essential for helping children reach their full potential, particularly when they are not starting from a high-IQ baseline.
