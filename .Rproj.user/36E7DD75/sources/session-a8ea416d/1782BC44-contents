GRACE DELACROIX 

This website presents selected quantitative work from my undergraduate studies in political science. The projects apply statistical analysis to questions of development, democratic representation, and political communication. Together they reflect my developing ability to use data to examine how structural conditions shape social and political outcomes.

The site is built using R, R Markdown, and the Distill framework.

Featured Projects

Impact of Mother’s Characteristics on Child Test Scores

This project investigates how maternal IQ and educational attainment relate to child cognitive outcomes using NLSY data. The analysis explores how family advantage operates not only through baseline ability but through structural stability, showing that educational attainment strengthens the translation of maternal resources into child development.

Democratic Scale: UK Constituency Size Analysis

This study examines variation in constituency sizes across the United Kingdom to understand patterns in democratic representation. By comparing voter distributions across countries within the UK, the analysis highlights structural imbalances that shape electoral equality and representation.

Political Communications: A/B Testing and Treatment Effects

This project evaluates a digital A/B test to determine how different homepage messaging strategies influence supporter signup rates. Using treatment effect estimation and interaction modeling, the analysis explores how political communication effectiveness varies across demographic groups.


About the Website

The portfolio documents my progression in quantitative analysis within political science. Each project combines statistical modeling, data visualization, and substantive interpretation to examine how institutional structures and social conditions influence outcomes.
